voice controlled cooking assistant: 

Overview
The Voice-Controlled Cooking Assistant is a cross-platform mobile application designed to deliver a truly hands-free cooking experience. Built with React Native (or Flutter), the app integrates advanced voice recognition and transcription technologies, allowing users to navigate recipes, set timers, and save or share their favorite dishes—all through natural voice commands.

Tech Stack
 Frontend: React Native (or Flutter)

 Backend: Node.js with Express

Voice Interfaces:

 Web Speech API – Real-time voice recognition and synthesis

 OpenAI Whisper API – High-accuracy transcription, especially in noisy environments or for fallback use
 
 Database: Firebase Firestore

 State Management: Redux (or MobX as an alternative)

Core Features
 1. Voice Command Activation
   Toggleable passive listening for privacy

   Recognizes trigger phrases like:

   “Start recipe”

   “Next step”

   “Set timer for 5 minutes”

    Uses Web Speech API for real-time interaction

    Whisper API used for enhanced accuracy or offline transcription

 2. Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions
   Instructions are fetched and read aloud one at a time

   Supports commands like:

   “Next”

   “Repeat”

   “Go back”

    Visual UI includes progress tracking for each recipe step

 3. Smart Timer Integration
